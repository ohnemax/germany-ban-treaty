## Abstract 

Germany is one of the currently five countries that host U.S. tactical nuclear weapons on their soil. According to the recently negotiated Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons ('Ban Treaty'), such stationing would be prohibited.

What would happen if Germany decides to join the Ban Treaty? And how could it be initiated?

This talk gives some answers to these questions. It discusses the current status of the tactical nuclear weapons and the designated delivery systems. The withdrawal of tactical nuclear weapons has been favored by a number of actors in the recent past. As such, the decision is not domestic alone, but may be influenced by NATO partners and the European Union and its member states. In case of success of the withdrawal, such actions could very likely be combined Germany's decision to join the Ban-Treaty. To do so, Germany would be required to take a number of steps, including to request the removal of the weapons and possibly additional domestic legislation. These steps will be outlined, and possible options to verify successful withdrawal will be presented and analyzed.
